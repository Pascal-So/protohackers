## Spoilers Ahead

### 01 - Prime Time

The grader here seems to be very lax, according to the problem description we might get an input like `1.3e1` to which we'd obviously have to return `true`, but such an input never occurs.

### 02 - Means to an End

Sum is biiig

### 03 - Budget Chat

Be careful to not inform a user about events that happened after the user connected but before they fully joined.

### 04 - Unusual Database Program

Don't strip newlines!

### 05 - Mob in the Middle

Don't get confused by reading the messages sent by the tester. One message reads "7PBqhi52gBQukUuL4EUegLYQHW is too short", yet the address is valid and should be replaced.
